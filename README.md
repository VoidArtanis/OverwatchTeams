# OverwatchTeams

A platform to help Overwatch players find their dream team. This app allow users to find team mates of their liking by filtering skill stats of other players. It also allows players to form teams, enabling them to 
organize practice matches and tournaments. The app is integrated with discord allowing the users to create one click voice calls to the entire team. It also sends reminders to team mates before a match and keeps 
everyone updated.
